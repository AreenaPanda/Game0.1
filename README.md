# p5.play-boilerplate
Boiler plate for p5.play

Ma'am... In sketch.js from line 118 to line 122, the code I've commented has something wrong.. As you told to write the function name instead of the variable name.. I did that but its still not working.. 

Also ma'am... In sketch.js line 93..  I tried adding an animation.. But its not working.. I checked the spellings, semi colons.. But didn't found anything.. 

Ma'am please help me solving these bugs.. After these bugs get solved all I have to do is add some sound and score.. 
Thankyou!
